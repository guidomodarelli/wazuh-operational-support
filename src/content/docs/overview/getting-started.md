## TL;DR

- Use the sidebar to browse topics, or search if available.
- Each page follows: Context → Steps → Examples → Troubleshooting → References.
- Check frontmatter tags and prerequisites at the top of each page.
- Prefer guides for workflows and reference for API/details.

## Context

This site organizes knowledge into two main areas:

- Guides: goal-oriented walkthroughs to solve tasks or issues.
- Reference: concise, factual details and lookups.

Pages are written to be action-first, predictable, and skimmable. If you're new here, start with a guide that matches your task, then dive into reference entries for deeper details.

## Steps

1) Identify your goal
   - Are you trying to fix an issue, learn a concept, or follow a procedure?

2) Find the right page
   - Browse the left sidebar by section (e.g., Guides, Reference).
   - Use the site search if enabled to jump directly to a page or heading.

3) Scan the structure quickly
   - TL;DR: immediate summary of the outcome and scope.
   - Context: what this page covers, prerequisites, and supported versions.
   - Steps: actionable sequence to complete the task.
   - Examples: copy‑pastable snippets to accelerate execution.
   - Troubleshooting: common errors and fixes.
   - References: related docs and external links.

4) Execute safely
   - Validate prerequisites (versions, roles, environment) before running commands.
   - Apply steps in order; note optional vs. required steps.

5) If you get stuck
   - Re‑check the Troubleshooting section on the same page.
   - Look for related guides linked at the bottom.
   - Use tags (e.g., how-to, faq, bug) to refine your search.

## Examples

- Resolve a connection issue: open the guide "Wazuh API 55000 timeout (GCP)" at `/guides/wazuh-api-55000-connection-timeout-gcp/` and follow the Steps section.
- Learn a concept: use Reference pages for definitions and parameters, then return to a guide to apply them.

## Troubleshooting

- Can’t find a topic: try a simpler query, check synonyms, or browse by tags.
- Confusing page: look for the TL;DR and Context to confirm scope; if your scenario differs, check related guides.
- Broken or missing info: report it in the repo or contact the page owner listed in the frontmatter.
